# Growler

## THE GOAL
- Twitter may be dominant today, but let's start working on the next big thing. You're going to make a micro-blogging application called **GROWLER** using **SINATRA**. All the cool things we've covered this week will be put to use!

- **User stories:**
  - The user can write Growls (micro-blogs) of 142 characters maximum!
  - The user can see all the Growls that have been written.

## GROUPS

* Christy, Todd
* Kelly, Bonnie
* James, Munish
* Zolon, Alison
* Ryan, Noble
* Antonia, Jason
* Lauren, Allie

## PHASES

### PHASE 1 - NO COMPUTERS
- **Pseudo code** and break it down into objects.
  - You'll want to work with a Growl resource/model/class. What attributes/properties should a Growl have?
  - Think about the structure of your application, using the Model-View-Controller pattern.
  - Figure out the user flow of your application, and think about how the different pages correspond with CRUD controller actions.
  - Include some wireframes if you feel good!

### PHASE 2 - SET UP A GIT REPO
- Using GitHub, set up a public repository and add your partner as a collaborator.
- **TIP**: Remember to check the box for initializing a README file so that a ```master``` branch is automatically created for you.
- **Copy the files in this folder into your new repository as starter code!**
- Remember to push your commits so that your partner can pull the code down when it's their turn to program.

### PHASE 3 - PAIR PROGRAMMING
- Create a new `growler` database and a table for your Growls in SQL.
- Set up a model, a views folder, and a controller for your Growls.
  - **Make sure to `use` your new controller in your `config.ru` file!**
  - Set the `views` path in your new controller using something like: `set :views, Proc.new { File.join(root, "views/growls") }`
- Time to set up some `GET` routes!
- You will need paths to:
  - Show all the Growls
  - Render a form to write new Growls
- Move on to the `POST` routes.
  - How will the user create Growls?
  - How will you persist that information?
  - What view will the user see once their Growl is saved?

### PHASE 4 - SET UP THE LOOK
- Set up a `public` folder to store your CSS and images.
- Write the CSS to apply some basic styles.
- **TIP**: Add a Bootswatch theme to your `layout.erb` file!

### PHASE 5
- Show your creations!
- Things you will cover:
  - Demo
  - Show some code
  - What did you struggle with and how did you solve it?
  - Things to do differently
- **Everyone has to talk :)**

### BONUS
  - Allow people to go to a single Growl's show page.
  - Add tagging functionality.
  - Add commenting functionality.
  - Add a user profile page that will show only the user's Growls. How will you differentiate between users?
